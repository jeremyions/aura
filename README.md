## 3. Next Steps

1. **Establish Documentation:** This README provides the blueprint for the project.
2. **Scaffold Development Environment:** Begin setting up the coding environment (e.g., Next.js for chat interface or your preferred stack).
3. **Develop Chat Interface:** Create the initial layout and functionalities for textual interaction.
4. **Implement Backend Services:** Set up user authentication, context management, and integration with AI services.

This is our starting point. As we progress, we can refine the architecture and add more detailed modules.
